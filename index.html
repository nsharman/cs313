            "It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out.
            Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. It will all 
            work out. If you do your best, it will all work out. Put your 
            trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the 
            future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. 
            ... If we will put our trust in Him, If we will pray to Him, If 
            we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers."
